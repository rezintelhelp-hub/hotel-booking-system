      "answer": "GAS (Global Accommodation System) is a FREE accommodation inventory management system. You upload your property details, connect your channel manager (like Beds24), and GAS handles the rest - syncing availability, powering your website, and managing your content. The key thing: bookings always flow through YOUR channel manager, so you stay in control.",

      ],
      "answer": "The core GAS system is completely FREE - you can upload unlimited properties and units at no cost. The only requirement is connecting via a channel manager. Optional paid services include: GAS-hosted websites, custom domains, travel agent distribution, and premium features. But the inventory management itself? Always free.",

        "Can I use GAS without a channel manager?"
      ],
      "answer": "A channel manager is the software that handles your actual bookings and distributes your inventory to sites like Booking.com and Airbnb. GAS requires one because we're an inventory MANAGEMENT system, not a booking engine. Your channel manager (Beds24, Smoobu, etc.) processes payments and manages reservations - GAS syncs with it to display your availability and power your website.",
